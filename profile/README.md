## 🎯 Project Overview & Goals
This project aims to build a Data Labeling Support System for training and evaluating machine learning models. The system supports multiple labeling tasks, such as identifying objects in images, drawing bounding boxes around objects, and segmenting object regions. Its goal is to manage the entire data labeling lifecycle, from project creation and task assignment to labeling, quality review, and data export, ensuring high-quality labeled datasets that improve the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models.

## 🏷️ Labeling Data Workflow
1. Project Manager creates a labeling project and uploads raw data (images, text, audio, or video).

2. The system validates the dataset, assigns task IDs, and distributes labeling tasks to annotators.

3. Annotators perform labeling tasks (e.g., classification, bounding boxes, or segmentation) following defined guidelines.

4. Reviewer checks label quality and approves, requests revisions, or rejects the annotations.

5. The system updates labeling status, tracks progress, and exports the verified labeled data for training and evaluating AI models.
